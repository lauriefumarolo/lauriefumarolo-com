				<h2>Koha Pets</h2>
				<p>I was independently contracted as a BigCommerce developer to add new features to this existing site based on the client's requirements.</p>
				<p>After a customer adds a product to their cart from the product details page, it is determined whether or not a free sample should be offered. If so, and the sample products are not already in their cart, I show a pop-up displaying two options the customer can choose from. A cart level discount that is set up in the backend removes the cost.</p>
				<p>This is a BigCommerce site and utilizes BigCommerce's Stencil API.</p>

				<h2>Robotic Construction Automation, LLC</h2>
				<p>I implemented this site for RCA, LLC, a company that will be offering a new concept for constructing multi-story, multi-dwelling facilities. I was hired as a web developer to build this new site based on the client's design.</p>
				<p>On the homepage, I utilized the Bootstrap grid to fulfill the client's requirement for a left-right, snaking flow chart on larger screens, but adapt to a purely vertical layout on mobile devices.</p>
				<p>This responsive site is built on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap.</p>

				<h2>City Planetarium</h2>
				<p>I created this site to demonstrate my knowledge of Twitter's Bootstrap framework and other modern web design trends. Here, I have included parallax scrolling and a large image banner on the homepage. The transparent menubar over this banner makes quite a statement. To maintain readability, however, I have written JavaScript to remove the effect as the user scrolls down the page.</p>

				<h2>jBaquery</h2>
				<p>I built this site to fulfill the final requirement of an interactive web development certificate program at my community college. I utilized jQuery plugins for the home page carousel and image galleries, as well as to validate the contact form.</p>
